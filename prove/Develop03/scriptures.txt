 
 I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.; John 14 6 6
 
 And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.; Ether 12:27
